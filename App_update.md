Online Learning Platform Backend README
Overview
This README provides an exhaustive guide for the backend development of the Online Learning Platform, a scalable microservices-based system designed to support user authentication, course management, progress tracking, certification issuance, payment processing (including Paystack and card payments), notifications, analytics, and course enrollment. Built from the provided workflow and database schema (updated 06:07 PM GMT, Monday, July 28, 2025), this document details the architecture, microservice specifications, database design, development process, deployment strategy, operational guidelines, and API request/response types, including payment services using Paystack and card, analysis tools, progress tracking requests and responses, and course enrollment requests and responses, to ensure seamless backend-frontend communication. The target audience is the backend development team, with a focus on delivering a robust, secure, and maintainable application.
Project Structure
Adopt a clean architecture with a modular file naming convention: {service}/{entity}/{action}.{type} (e.g., auth/user/register.service.js, courses/catalog/list.controller.js, payment/gateway/process.request.js). Each microservice should reside in its own directory under the services/ root folder, with subdirectories for controllers, services, models, and utils. Example structure:

services/auth/
controllers/user.controller.js
services/user.service.js
models/user.model.js
utils/auth.utils.jsUse a consistent RESTful routing structure mirroring the file system (e.g., /api/auth/user/register, /api/courses/catalog/list, /api/payment/gateway/status) to ensure intuitive API navigation. All configuration files (e.g., .env, config.json) should be placed in a config/ directory at the root level.



Architecture
The backend is a distributed microservices architecture, ensuring separation of concerns, scalability, and fault isolation. Services communicate via asynchronous messaging (e.g., RabbitMQ for events like enrollment or payment success) and synchronous RESTful APIs routed through an API Gateway (e.g., Kong or Express Gateway). Each service should be stateless, with state management handled by a centralized database or cache (e.g., Redis).

Development Process & Compliance

Chosen Process: Implement Scrum with 5-day sprints for iterative development and Kanban with WIP limits (e.g., 3 tasks per developer) for task flow optimization. This aligns with Pressman Chapters 2-3, supporting rapid prototyping and continuous improvement for a team collaboration project.
DevSecOps Guard-rails:
Branch Protection: Protect main, develop, and release/* branches, requiring two approvals and passing CI checks.
CI Test Coverage Gate: Enforce 80% unit test coverage, integrated with Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
Secret Scanning: Use tools like TruffleHog to detect and block secrets in commits.


Gen-AI Usage: Permit AI for boilerplate (e.g., API controllers), documentation, and initial schemas, but all artifacts must be reviewed and explained by developers during bi-weekly audits to ensure ownership and quality.

Implementation Guidelines

Performance Considerations: Design APIs with O(n) time complexity for operations like enrollment validation (linear search for duplicates) and O(1) for certificate retrieval (hashed lookups). For Media Repository, use index for O(log n) retrieval with a B-tree index. Space complexity is O(n) for scalable data, optimized with indexing and caching (e.g., Redis).
Error Handling: Standardize error responses (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error) with JSON payloads containing status, data, error, and timestamp. Implement global exception handling per service.
Logging: Use a centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK Stack) to capture request logs, errors, and analytics events with timestamps and correlation IDs.
Security: Enforce HTTPS with TLS 1.3, JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens, input validation (e.g., Joi), and rate limiting (e.g., 100 requests/min/user) to mitigate attacks. Secure Paystack and card transactions with encryption.
Data Integrity: Use transactions for enrollment, payment, and media upload operations to ensure consistency.

Deployment

Environment Setup:
Development: Local Docker Compose setup with mock services.
Staging: AWS EC2 with Kubernetes for testing.
Production: AWS EKS with auto-scaling groups.


Containerization: Dockerize each microservice with a Dockerfile and use docker-compose.yml for local development. Include health checks and resource limits.
Orchestration: Deploy with Kubernetes, using Helm charts for configuration. Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaling based on CPU/memory usage.
Monitoring: Integrate Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for dashboards, and Alertmanager for notifications (e.g., downtime alerts).
CI/CD: Set up Jenkins or GitHub Actions with pipelines for build, test, and deploy stages. Include linting (e.g., ESLint) and security scans (e.g., Snyk).

Collaboration

Team Workflow: Use Git with a branching strategy: main for production, develop for integration, feature/{task} for development (e.g., feature/auth-login). Conduct daily 15-minute stand-ups and bi-weekly 1-hour retrospectives.
Documentation: Maintain API specifications with OpenAPI 3.0 in docs/api-spec.yaml. Update this README with version history and change logs.
Communication: Use Slack for real-time coordination and Jira for task tracking, with epics for each microservice.

Operational Guidelines

Backup Strategy: Schedule daily database backups to AWS S3 with 30-day retention.
Disaster Recovery: Implement a multi-region deployment with failover to a secondary AWS region.
Incident Response: Define an on-call rotation with a 15-minute SLA for critical issues, logged in PagerDuty.
